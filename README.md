# Creative Problem Solving Through Graphic Designs

This repository brings together a selection of projects that reflect my work across **graphic design**, **system planning**, and **foundational programming concepts**. Each artifact represents a different problem space and the way I approached understanding, structuring, and presenting solutions.

## E-Waste Management App (Google Solutions Hackathon)
This project focused on addressing e-waste challenges through a mobile application concept. I contributed by designing the **system architecture** to outline data flow and components, along with **wireframes** to visualize user interaction and application structure.

## Hospital Emergency Prototype
A prototype developed using **C programming**, where core emergency handling logic was modeled using the **Queue data structure**. The project emphasizes applying data structure concepts to real-world scenarios in a clear and structured way.

## Freelance Design Work
Includes **certificate design** and **Memento** and many other creative assets created for freelance clients. These works highlight skills in **visual hierarchy**, **layout**, and translating client requirements into clean, functional designs.

## Overview
Overall, this repository represents my learning journey and practical experience, presenting projects through the lens of **graphic design**, where design thinking, visual clarity, and structured problem-solving come together.
